# TTY

# Colors

Use [setcolors](http://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/linux-vt-set-colors)
to change tty colors. Palette files gathered by that project are
stored in tty/colors.

# Fonts

Use setfont to change tty font. Ubuntu fonts generated from the
ubuntu/font-family/sources package (with the makefile in debian/console)
are stored in tty/fonts.
